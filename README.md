countries
=========

Ever wanted just a simple file that allows you to get a country's name from its two-letter code? LOOK NO FURTHER. HERE IT IS.
In csv format. All your hopes and dreams came true. No more scraping in the dark, dealing with governmental bodies' inabilities
to piece together HTML in a rational, readable way, in an encoding that actually makes sense. Now you don't need to waste an hour
on Saturday trying to find this information!!!!!!!
